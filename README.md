## Design Methodologies

### Agile
The project is primarily built using the [Agile](https://www.cprime.com/resources/what-is-agile-what-is-scrum/)
methodology. Each feature is planned first before development begins and developed incrementally
without breaking the existing app.

### Modularised
This app is highly modularised. There are different packages for different screens that only contain
the logic for that screen, like Activity or Fragment classes, ViewModel, Adapters, etc.
Following a modularised approach makes the app scalable and less daunting to understand.
